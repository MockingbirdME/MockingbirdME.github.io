title: Alexa First Impressions
---

It's been a while since I added anything here, and that should change.  I've been working on developing new skills for Amazon's Alexa for the Amazon Echo.  My first project was a simple trivia game asking questions about Monty Python's Holy Grail with hopes to expand it to include Indiana Jones the Last Crusade as well and any other Holy Grail trivia I can think of.

For this first project I used a template to help me create my Alexa Skill.  The template gave me a lot of the background, grunt work, code that for future skills I hope to write myself but for this particular project I was more interested in learning my way around Alexa skill development procedures than worrying about some of the details, and like anyone who's ever written a Hello World program knows: seeing your code work for the first time lets you believe you can be successful.

My first impression is that Amazon has done a fantastic job designing a positive user experience for developers creating new skills for Alexa, everything is well laid out and fairly intuitive in where it's placed.  The major complaint I have is that the documentation has not kept up with the development site.  I spent hours trying to find the write place to set some settings and start working with triggers, something the documentation calls events, all because the docs has me chasing ghosts.

I am excited to see if Amazon accepts the skill I've built for them and look forward to producing more content for Alexa.  Who knows maybe I'll even tell my wife I want an Amazon Echo for Christmas.
